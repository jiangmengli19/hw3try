## Introduction

```{r importdata}
library(RCurl)
download <- getURL("https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/grades.csv")
gradedata <- read.csv(text = download)
View(gradedata)
```

Now we try to describe the grade data generally.
Apart from that, we also try to describe the gradedata of first and second columns
```{r}
summary(gradedata)
firstcoltest <- gradedata[["Test3"]]
secondcoltest <- gradedata[["Test2"]]
summary(firstcoltest)
summary(secondcoltest)
```
